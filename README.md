# ortus-regni-server

An open-source server for Ortus Regni. Created for the purpose for allowing the players to experience the game after the
official servers have shut down. The work is non-commercial and I have no affiliation with the game's developer

Python used: 3.12

How to run:
1 - install python 3.12
2 - run in the root of the project: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3 - run `python start_server.py`

Note: the server is not production ready, and it requires further modifications before being used as such,
  especially if over the internet instead of locally
